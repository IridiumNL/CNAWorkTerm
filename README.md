# CNAWorkTerm
Git for Stephen and myself


This repository is for the CNA 2017 scheduling project. 
Contains all the excel sheets with program schedules from 1168 and 1171 terms to be used as templates for future semesters.
They will be sent out for instructors at each campus to fill in, and loaded back into our PeopleSoft servers to achieve online scheduling for students at every CNA campus.
This will allow campus' to cut down on excess paper from handing out physical schedules and also have a convienent place for students to check grades, pay for their tuition and now also view their schedules.
